## About Me
My name is David, lives in Ho Chi Minh City, the south of Vietnam. I've been working as a Project Manager at YOMI Studio for the last 5 years - a digital product agency that builds products to grow clients' businesses. Also, I focus my time and efforts to help build our own's products that gave me many valuable lessons.


When products grow, I find myself facing a new challenge that dealing with data. Some questions immediately come to my mind when having data are:
* What to do with those data? 
* What are the insights that can help bring more value to the product and the business?
* How and where should we start?
* ...

One quote from Andrew Ng once said **"Some of the most successful businesses succeed by exploiting their users."** and I believe that's true, user-centric is the key and you have to understand your users to bring them more value, that will lead to the success of a business.


This project is a place for me to keep track of my learning. Not all resources record here, just the ones that I have completed so far and the following ones that are on my mind for a next step (in a short/medium or even long term).


Thanks to many good resources from MOOC, especially [Virgilio](https://github.com/virgili0/Virgilio#what-is-virgilio) :thumbsup: :thumbsup: :thumbsup: for such a great library and help me a lot during my journey.
